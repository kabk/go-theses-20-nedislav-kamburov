						<p>Chalga is a Bulgarian music genre, a mixture of Balkan rhythm and oriental embellishments. Being the most
							popular music genre in the country, it was intriguing what is it really and why the feelings towards it
							are so mixed. Where did it come from and where is it going?</p>
						<p> Listening to songs and watching videos, reading academic papers on Balkan music and talking to various
							artists, academics and casual listeners, I noticed how well chalga represents the needs of Bulgarian
							society. In a humorous way, it reflects excessive wealth, enjoyment and eroticism that people crave but
							are ashamed to admit. Chalga ties into a much deeper problem of disturbed national identity, where it
							serves as a vent to release all that pressure.</p>

					<p> I don’t easily get offended but when I heard the term balkanisation, a derogatory geopolitical term for
						the process of fragmentation or division of a region or state into smaller regions or states that are
						often hostile or uncooperative with one another, I lost my temper. The Balkans (Fig.1) have had a
						turbulent history of conquest by the Romans, various nomadic tribes, the Ottoman Empire and they have
						always survived. What led to the assumption that they are more uncooperative with one another than other
						European nations? What is this cloak of dishonour covering the region? Undoubtedly, there is much to be
						proud of—but what is it? Food, dances, knowledge or music? All regions in the world can boast with
						something even if it seems strange or even disturbing to foreigners.</p>

					</figure>
					<p> For me and many other Bulgarians this is chalga music, a popular upbeat music with oriental blemishes
						and provocative imagery and lyrics. There can’t be Bulgaria without chalga and vice versa. Despite the
						attraction to its rhythmical and joyful sounds, chalga is not openly accepted. ‘We are forced to listen to
						it’, ‘You just have no choice’ or ‘We have grown up with it, what do you expect?’ are some of the common
						arguments for listening to chalga. But when Dimityr Dimitrov, the owner of the biggest chalga production
						company Planeta Payner, applied for an EU subsidy worth millions of euros, he was publicly
						shamed.<sup><a id='fnote-1' href="#note-1">1</a></sup> As
						if people feared chalga becoming bigger or, even worse, becoming popular in the West.</p>
					<p> When I was a teenager in the early 2010s, some people expressed their hatred for chalga and stood to
						make chalga illegal for listening. I was into Black Sabbath and Guns n’ Roses and I did not listen to
						chalga but I was also indifferent to such strong emotions. In the Netherlands, however, chalga was like
						discovering the ‘fountain of youth’ for my homesick soul. At parties we were provoking our foreign friends
						by playing classic tracks that we would not play at home. I wondered what held me back all this time? How
						could there be so much reservation around one music genre? Tracing its history, I found out it offers much
						more than a few scandalous videos and provocative lyrics. It reveals a history of adaptation, infusion of
						cultures and rhythms, which served as a coping mechanism for the post-Soviet reality. For the last 30 years
						it has been an accurate reflection of Bulgarian society while staying the most popular music genre since
						its conception. Shows in the US, Canada, England or the Netherlands get many Bulgarians together and their
						hearts are stricken with loads of emotions of familiarity and saudade. Paradoxically, in Bulgaria most
						people are ashamed by it. They deny that chalga reflects their world so well, labelling it as ‘foreign
						and inauthentic’.</p>

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a id="chapter2">Overview of chalga</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p> Chalga is the Bulgarian version of the Balkan folk music known as Turbo-folk in Serbia, Laiko in Greece,
						Manele in Romania or Tallava in Albania. Musically it strongly resembles oriental music due to
						asymmetrical rhythms and instruments like the accordion or violin. However the visual language rarely
						references directly anything related to Turkey or the Ottoman Empire, belly dancing being the exception.
						Chalga flourished in the 90s popularised almost completely by its video material. Much like MTV in the
						West, Bulgarian producers realised that music clips were essential to promote songs on cable TV, in clubs
						and cafes.<sup><a id="fnote-2" href="#note-2">2</a></sup> The quality of those videos varied but it took a
						very short
						time for producers to
						excel<sup><a id="fnote-3" href="#note-3">3</a></sup>
						in it going from ‘amateur one-camera shots to sophisticated professionalism.’ The production quality
						nowadays is relatively high and it is hard to distinguish from any Western production. Unless, of course,
						we look into the content of the videos.</p>
					<p> There are several themes which reappear since the 90s, which serve as strong symbols of the Bulgarian
						needs and desires for opportunity and freedom. For 30 years of democracy materialistic needs haven’t been
						generally satisfied. Chalga is the music that gives a peek into a world of abundant riches, it provides
						joy and excitement and breaks the social reservations with loosely clothed men and women, exposing the
						innate sexual drive of everyone. Those themes are not unique, but perhaps chalga took them to another
						level.<sup><a id="fnote-4" href="#note-4">4</a></sup> Being provocative, satirical and hyperbolical about
						every visual
						trope, producers
						market their
						content in almost every corner of the country and even beyond.</p>

			<div class="chapter chapter-3">
				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a id="chapter3">Inferiority Complex</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p>In the beginning of the 20th century the Bulgarian writer Aleko Konstantinov tells the story of Bai Ganio
						who is a ‘typical Bulgarian character’. With his sharp trading mind and fabulously bushy moustache he
						departs to Vienna to explore the Western world, share Bulgarian culture and earn some money on the side by
						selling rose oil. Unfortunately, he exposes his Balkan manners a few times, such as shouting on the
						streets of Vienna or banging his chest, growling ‘Bulgar! Bulgar!’ to announce his home country. Bai Ganio
						is not a terrible man, but he is a collective character for all negative Bulgarian traits like profanity,
						egocentrism, hedonism and greed. He was created to remind the people that one should behave in a society
						with different ideals and culture and leave the ‘Orientalist thinking’ behind. Perhaps it worked all too
						well, because one is humiliated when accused of manifesting such traits, traits that chalga easily
						exemplifies.</p>
					<p>Shame is very interesting as a psychological phenomenon because it needs an external viewer. In contrast
						to guilt that is internal and concerns the action, e.g. murder, that has been done, shame is pointed at
						the doer and their moral values, e.g. being disrespecful to war heroes. Nevertheless, there are actions
						that are classified as ‘bringing shame’. In his book<sup><a id="fnote-5" href="#note-5">5</a></sup> Musical
						Concerns,
						Jerrold Levinson points
						out that
						‘ashamed’ is one of them. Another one is ‘shameful’. A shameful musical taste is when
						you like music
						people generally find repulsive. Would the opposite be positive? Shameful → shameless? No, it is also a
						negative adjective. So it seems as soon as something is labeled as shameful it is hard to reverse it.
						Chalga music, in all its forms, has been criticised by people in the 19th, 20th and 21st century.
						Nevertheless, it did not stop developing, adapting, reflecting Bulgarian reality. And the arguments
						against it have always been the same: too vulgar, too erotic, too ‘foreign’.</p></br>
					<p>But if chalga shows reality, how come it is so shameful? Reality cannot be repulsive, but the perception
						of it can be. ‘Chalga’ has come to be an adjective used to denote poor-quality variation of a
						thing:
						‘chalga politicians’, ‘chalga historians’, ‘chalga culture’.<sup><a id="fnote-6" href="#note-6">6</a></sup>
						And
						moreover, people talk about
						‘spiritual
						emigration’ which is a result of ‘chalgization’ of the whole nation.<sup><a id="fnote-7"
								href="#note-7">7</a></sup>Thus,
						suggesting
						that one
						sole
						music genre is responsible for the harsh and unfair reality. So is Bulgaria chalgagized? National identity
						is a puzzling construct, because of two subjugations that lasted for centuries. The first by the Byzantine
						Empire for almost two centuries and the second by the Ottoman Empire for five centuries. The latter being
						so long, that almost assimilated the native culture and traditions. After the liberation in 1878, Bulgaria
						suddenly had to respond to Europe. At the time the ‘elite’ was already identifying with other
						cultures
						trying to reject everything Ottoman or traditionally Bulgarian.<sup><a id="fnote-8"
								href="#note-8">8</a></sup> In the
						influential novel
						<span class='link'><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phoney_Civilization'>Криворазбраната
								цивилизация (The Phoney
								Civilization)</a></span> Dobri Voynikov humours a lifestyle, where
						traditional values are left behind as old-fashioned, while blindly copying everything French and Austrian.
						In a way this is a reaction to the simplicity and coarseness of Bai Ganio, as much as a desire for a more
						prosperous life. It also lurks as a longing for a fargone glory, when the Second Bulgarian Kingdom had
						spanned over the Balkan peninsula. After breaking from the Ottoman rule, Bulgaria felt under-developed,
						inadequate in the new European context. A sense of inferiority was kindled. Georgi Hadzhyiski<sup><a
								href="#note-9">9</a></sup>
						defines 3
						symptoms of this complex:
					</p>
					<ul class='list'>
						<li><span class="note-num">1.</span> A feeling of shame, because every textbook teaches the historical
							misfortune the nation has endured
							with many subjugations, slaughter and plunder.</li>
						<li><span class="note-num">2.</span> A feeling of guilt, caused by the occasions when strong leaders were
							betrayed and the
							disillusionment that nobody may ever again resemble heroic figures from history books and folk stories.
						</li>
						<li><span class="note-num">3.</span> Megalomaniac tendencies, aiming to amend those feelings by twisting
							reality and exaggerating every
							facet of Bulgarian society, e.g. its uniqueness, strength, intelligence and innate decency and humility.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Megalomania usually uses historical and geographical facts to support its intentions. In 1762, Paisii
						Hilendarski finished the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istoriya_Slavyanobolgarskaya">История
							Славянобългaрска (Slavonic-Bulgarian History)</a> where he fitted
						numerous examples of the great history of the Bulgarian nation. A substantial work which inspired several
						liberation movements. It becomes problematic, however, when the ‘beating in the chest’ goes out of hand.
						When Paisii Hilendarski compiled his ‘history’ he picked only the relevant heroic examples of
						Bulgarian
						history and left out many not so interesting in order to prove his point. His text is not so much a
						historical account, as it is a literary masterpiece.<sup><a id="fnote-10" href="#note-10">10</a></sup>Of
						course, it did
						not include any
						accounts of the
						Ottoman rule. Three hundred years later this attitude has backfired. And when chalga brought any allusions
						to the Orient (not Ottoman, but close enough), it hit right in the heart of many. Today, however, with
						much more refined historical knowledge the Bulgarian nation can build a more grounded approach in order to
						position itself in the European Union with a solemn acceptance of its disreputable past.</p>
					<p>Several hundred years later in 1981, a celebration was held for 1300 years since the founding of the
						state. I imagine that rudimentary questions of identity arose: What is our ethnos? Where do we come from?
						What are our traditions? Great monuments<sup><a id="fnote-11" href="#note-11">11</a></sup> were built, films
						were
						produced and opulent events
						were
						organised solely to commemorate the occasion. Furthermore, Socialism brought more than fake confidence in
						our history, it also introduced socialist values, introduced by the ‘communist morality’.<sup><a
								href="#note-12">12</a></sup>
						These are
						practically positive and negative character traits that a citizen should consider. Unity, patriotism,
						honesty, discipline, hard-work are prefered over individualism, hedonism, laziness and disloyalty. Chalga
						checks all the boxes of traits one would avoid. When democracy came in 1989, Bulgaria started looking away
						from the East. It was more and more attacked for its lighthearted nature and striking aesthetics and
						perhaps people had enough of it. It is unclear, but every decade it adapts and people continue to
						shamelessly and shamefully listen to its pumping rhythm.</p>

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a id="chapter4">The Origins of Chalga</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p> Almost five centuries of Ottoman presence have put a mark on the Balkan cuisine, music, language and
						morality.<sup><a id="fnote-13" href="#note-13">13</a></sup> Nations were forced to adapt to a new unknown
						culture and
						religion. Therefore the
						Balkans
						share many cultural aspects such as pastries like banitsa (burek) or wedding rituals which involve some
						kind of ‘abduction’ of the bride. In music, what is mostly present is the oriental melodies and
						choreography and Romani instruments and rhythms.</p>
					<p> In 1973 the Bulgarian ethnographer Raina Katsarova followed how the song Üsküdara
						gilder
						iken (On
						the way to Üsküdar), originally an Ottoman song, spread
						through the Balkans.<sup><a id="fnote-14" href="#note-14">14</a></sup> Listening to it (Fig.3) one can
						easily distinguish the oriental flavour, because of the traditional Turkish lute and style of singing. The
						lyrics tell the story of a woman travelling to Uskudar. On the way there she finds a handkerchief, fills
						it up with turkish delight and shares it with a clerk in her carriage, who she has been admiring all
						along.</p>

					</figure>
					<figcaption>Fig.3 Üsküdar'a Gider İken (Kâtibim)</figcaption>
					<p> Some versions<sup><a id="fnote-15" href="#note-15">15</a></sup> stayed close to the original such as the
						Serbian
						version <a href="https://lyricstranslate.com/en/ruse-kose-curo-ima%C5%A1-girl-you-have-mahogany-hair.html">
							Ruse kose curo imaš
							(Red-haired girl)</a> or the Greek one—<a
							href="https://lyricstranslate.com/en/Apo-kseno-topo-foreign-place.html">Apo xeno topo (From a foreign
							place)</a>, where
						they retell a love story
						similar to the original. However, the Bulgarian variation <a
							href="https://textove.com/patriotichni-pesni-yasen-mesets-vech-izgryava-tekst">Ясен месец веч изгрява (A
							clear moon is already
							rising)</a> version is much more militant in its content. This demonstrates (Fig.4) how a song could
						spread
						and morph among people who speak different languages but share similar culture.</p>
					<figure class="imageWrapper"> <img src="images/uskudar-lyrics-comparison3.jpg"
							alt="Fig.4 Lyrics of the Üsküdara gilder iken">
						<figcaption>Fig.4 Lyrics of the Üsküdara gilder iken</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p> Furthermore, in Bulgaria the origins of the song and its current meaning clash to create a slight irony.
						A very patriotic song about protecting the motherland from the Ottoman Turks, currently still the ‘hymn of
						the Stranzha mountain’,<sup><a id="fnote-16" href="#note-16">16</a></sup> that originates in the land of the
						oppressor.
						In Adela Peeva’s film
						Чия е тази
						песен? (Whose is this song?),<sup><a id="fnote-17" href="#note-17">17</a></sup> she asks a group of people
						if they know
						the history of the
						melody in
						this song. They seem oblivious to its roots and when Peeva reveals ‘They have it in Turkey too!’ a rapid
						change of mood transforms the confused faces from gleeful to furious. These people have gathered to
						celebrate an uprising against the Ottoman oppressors and this woman comes to spoil their illusion. One man
						is so disappointed (Fig.5) by her comment, he tells her that he would ‘stone anybody who claims such a
						historical
						connection’.</p>
					<figure class="imageWrapper"> <img src="images/yasen-mesets.jpg"
							alt="Fig.5 Film still from ‘Whose is this song?’ by Adela Peeva">
						<figcaption>Fig.5 Film still from ‘Whose is this song?’ by Adela Peeva</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p> Peeva ends the film asking herself ‘How could one song incite so much hatred?’ This reaction is not
						surprising at all. Folk music is taken seriously in Bulgaria, especially when it recorded the struggle of
						five centuries of Ottoman subjugation. The identity of the ‘Bulgarian free nation’ has been built by
						juxtaposing the times of suppression with those of freedom. During socialist times, this propaganda
						against the new Republic of Turkey fostered even a stronger national identity - the identity of ‘pure
						ethnos’, no Turkish or Roma connections, and ‘pure culture’, no Oriental cultural heritage. Thus it is of
						no surprise that the socialist regime was censoring the level of ‘chalga’ some wedding orchestras
						played
						in the 80s.<sup><a id="fnote-18" href="#note-18">18</a></sup> </p>
					<p class="quote">Since many wedding instrumentalists were Roma, they
						played Roma music,
						especially a dance
						called “kyuchek”.<sup><a id="fnote-19" href="#note-19">19</a></sup></p>
					<p> It was unacceptable to play Romani music at
						Bulgarian weddings. And to this
						day
						Romani people are looked down on when they perform. Or at least until a certain level of sobriety.</p>
					<p> In 1989, the Soviet Bloc crumbled and chalga boomed in popularity. Wedding music left the stage to
						ethno-sound combined with Romani musical elements, oriental eroticism, pure nonchalance of the ‘free
						spirit’. How could some ‘traditional Bulgarian folk’ music be related to Ottoman or Romani traditions?
						Nobody cared. No more rules. There were no copyrights, no censorship, people could sing and act however
						they saw fit.<sup><a id="fnote-20" href="#note-20">20</a></sup> Curiously, the music videos did not cross
						one line. The
						Ottoman Turkish
						aesthetic. Arab sheiks (Fig.6) and camels were fine because they were largely oriental,
						but
						Ottoman harem and mosques
						were taking matters too far. Some sort of ‘sanitized images’, too sensitive for Bulgarian audience, which
						chalga
						producers replaced with Arabic or Western metaphors.<sup><a id="fnote-21" href="#note-21">21</a></sup> In
						the article,
						Bulgarian Chalga on
						Video:
						Oriental Stereotypes, Mafia Exoticism, and Politics, Vesa Kurkela is examining the place orientalism takes
						among the audiences of chalga music. He describes the main variations of the videos like
						this:<sup><a id="fnote-22" href="#note-22">22</a></sup>
					</p>
					<p class="quote"> The videos also contain aggressive jokes that display little respect for anyone or
						anything. The objects of mockery are various—politicians, the state administration, the nouveaux riches,
						the Bulgarian mafia, policemen, macho culture, the sex business, Arab sheiks, superficial lovers of
						fashion, Russian folklore troupes, and various Western fashion phenomena. Ironic criticism is often so
						well hidden that the outsider cannot understand it without the guidance and explanation of local cultural
						experts. Nothing in chalga is serious and its contents stray very far from Western political correctness.

					<figcaption>Fig.6 Няма Шега (No Joke) by Kameliya </figcaption>
					<p> The post-Socialist period of the 1990s was extremely interesting from social, economical and political
						perspective. People had just been allowed to express themselves, or rather they were not forbidden to do
						so it. Years and years of censorship triggered foul language, slutty clothing, large golden crosses
						prominently hanging on the chest of whoever could afford it. This way people not only did not feel any
						shame but they were taking pride in showing their vulgarity. A perfect example would be Valdes’s Рибна
						Фиеста (Fish Fiesta)
						from 2001. The video (Fig.7) shows a fisherman playing an accordion
						semi-submerged in a
						river. From time to time he sways his fishing rod to pull not a fish but the underwear of an attractive
						woman sunbathing on the shore. If that isn’t enough, he appears to entertain his friends in a tavern
						having banknotes stuck to his forehead. Apparently, in 2001 the censorship came back because the chorus
						singing:</p>
					<ul class='list'>
						<li> И ловец съм, и рибар съм, </li>
						<li> на закона мамата ибал съм </li>
						<li> (I am a hunter, I am a fisherman) </li>
						<li> (I have fucked the
							law)</li>
						<li class='list-break'> which turned into the ‘censored’ version:</li>
						<li> И ловец съм, и рибар съм, </li>
						<li> на купона цар и господар съм </li>
						<li>(I am a
							hunter, I am a
							fisherman)</li>
						<li> (I am king and master of the party)</li>

					<p> Economically, most people struggled to survive and the terrible inflation of 1996 did little good. Dire
						times call for drastic measures as people tried to exchange Bulgarian levs for American dollars or German
						marks at all costs. Thus we can presume that people enjoyed listening to music that echoed their absurd
						lifestyle with a humorous spin. Nelina’s Бял Мерцедес (White Mercedes)
						shows a
						reality (Fig.8) where the
						protagonist is sent to buy dollars. Unfortunately, they do not have any left, but she is being
						followed by
						a white Mercedes where a hand from inside offers her dollars. She refuses to ‘exchange love for
						money’.

					<figcaption>Fig.8 Бял Мерцедес (White Mercedes) by Nelina</figcaption>
					<p> Certain people figured they could exploit the economic turmoil and organised strong men, usually former
						wrestlers or boxers, to ‘ask company owners to insure their business with them’ or ‘to pay for copyright
						for the music they play in cafes and restaurants’. Refusal to do so meant that they will lose their
						business and more. This gave rise to the mutri, or mafia, period from 1994 to 1999. They acquired loads of
						money using this ‘business model’ until the 2000s when the explicit violence and intimidation waned out.
						Certain artists were attracted to this and in 1995 Volodya Stoyanov was ‘abducted’ to sing for
						Vasil
						Iliev, mafia boss at the time.<sup><a id="fnote-23" href="#note-23">23</a></sup> Volodya had reservations at
						first but
						got used to performing
						for him
						and recorded the album (Fig.9) Пирамиди, Фараони (Pyramids, Pharaohs).
					</p>

					</figure>
					<p>
						Later in 1996 Rado Shisharkata and
						Ivan
						Karachorov–Popa also paid their tribute (Fig.10) by recording an absolute classic track, glorifying the
						mutri
						culture, called Тигре, тигре (Tiger, Tiger). They sing to someone
						(Vasil Iliev presumably) asking him if
						he has money, beautiful women and expensive Western cars or just old women and rusty Soviet cars. Both of
						these songs opened the scene for many mutri-songs and chalga became the main choice at most mafia parties.

					<p> Chalga was ‘music for the soul’ so politics found no place within it. In Bulgaria ‘politics’
						stands for
						activities associated with the government, not so much for anything ‘concerned with power and status’,
						e.g. ‘the politics of gender’. However, sometimes people appropriated songs for this purpose. Such is the
						case with Slavi Trifonov and Ku-Ku Band’s Тайсън Кючек (Tajsyn Kyuchek)
						which was played (Fig.11) at a protest at
						the end of 1996 firstly in Lom and later in Plovdiv.<sup><a id="fnote-24"
								href="#note-24">24</a></sup>Despite the show
						Kanaleto, which Slavi
						and Ku-ku
						Band were part of, being openly critical the prevailing government of Zhan Videnov, the song is still not
						explicitly political:</p>

					<figcaption>Fig.11 Тайсън Кючек (Tajsyn Kyuchek) by Slavi Trifonov & Ku-Ku Band</figcaption>
					<p> Breaking it down, the anaphora ‘seven-eight’ refers to boxing knock-out, therefore Tajsun is (Mike)
						Tyson, to imply some threat or taunt. It also refers to kyuchek dance with its asymmetric time signature
						(7/8), commonly appearing in Balkan music. Although nothing suggest political statements, protesters used
						it as a count-down for the ‘last hour’ of the government. Slavi Trifonov entered politics more seriously
						in the last decade. His albums Има такъв народ (There is such a nation) and Песни за българи (Songs for
						Bulgarians)<sup><a id="fnote-25" href="#note-25">25</a></sup> are interpretations of folk songs that were
						supposed to
						inspire Bulgarians to
						reclaim
						their state. In 2016 Slavi and Ku-Ku Band protested against the state at Orlov Most (major bridge in the
						centre of Sofia). Although the songs they performed were much more traditional, he is still known as the
						chalga performer and got a lot of criticism for it. His political motives are dubious, but his chalga
						influence is not. Some were agitated, some were grateful that a resistance to the state has been formed.
						Since then Slavi has moved on to create his own TV channel where he is 'free to go his own way’ and share
						his political views. It is still mainly an entertainment channel, but he is free of official
						censorship.<sup><a id="fnote-26" href="#note-26">26</a></sup> Whether this means there will be more chalga
						songs that
						take a political stance
						is yet to
						be seen.</p>

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a id="chapter5">The Production Evolution</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p> The songs from the 90s and early 2000s have become true gems within Bulgarian music history. Most people
						today have good memories from this time. People born in the 50s, 60s, 70s were in their prime age when the
						genre evolved. It was loud, energetic, rebellious, sexy, melancholic—it connected to all parts of life,
						good and bad. The children of those people grew up listening to chalga, which in turn brings them good
						memories.</p>
					<p> The music itself was not of the highest quality. The musical instruments were relatively cheap and easy
						to find but second-rate in quality which meant professionals were not satisfied. Soviet-made instruments
						were available, but the difference was miniscule. In-demand were East German keyboards and speakers or
						third- or fourth- hand Fender guitar imported from the West. The sound of those early songs was quite
						rough, the artist being a singer, musician, songwriter and producer. Nobody was taking it too seriously.
						Most of the music was light-hearted, exploring the possibilities. By 1992 two companies—Planeta Payner and
						Ara Music—were founded and have led the industry ever since. They focused on ‘pop-folk’ (the less
						derogatory term for chalga) and produced music, videos, audio cassettes and superstars. Most of the chalga
						artists popular in the 90s until today emerged from one of those two companies. In a couple of years
						everything changed immensely.</p>
					<p> Professional songwriters like Nadezhda Zaharieva and Zhivko Kolev<sup><a id="fnote-27"
								href="#note-27">27</a></sup>
						wrote many Bulgarian
						Estrada songs
						in Socialist times and now they were employed again. Songs by Signal, Lili Ivanova and Tangra are known by
						many Bulgarians. Nowadays they have crafted other absolute hits like <a
							href="https://lyrics-on.net/en/1084187-luda-po-tebe-luda-po-tebe-lyrics.html">Луда по тебе (Crazy about
							you)</a> and
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiEqUpnQsB0">Митничарю (Border guard)</a>. Were they happy to do
						that or not, we don’t know yet… The content of the songs
						remained lighthearted but technically they were written with a much better flow and rhythm. Perhaps this
						is one of the reasons these songs are so memorable.
					</p>
					<p> Recording studios and professional sound engineers allowed the artists to acquire top-notch music
						quality. Producers, stylists, make-up artists were responsible to present the artist in the best way.
						Rarely a song would be released without an accompanying music video. For the purpose of the promotion or
						additional profit, chalga videos gained huge success:</p>
					<p class="quote"> At the end of the 1990s the new style became an undisputed success on the Bulgarian
						popular music scene. The most popular chalga hits sold more than 100,000 copies, whereas domestic rock
						records could at best reach sales of 10–15,000 copies (Ivo Dochovski and Ventsislav Dimov, Interviews,
						1999).<sup><a id="fnote-28" href="#note-28">28</a></sup></p>
					<p> In the 2000s, the quality continued to grow producing more songs, more videos and more stars. Planeta TV
						was founded in 2001, followed by Planeta Folk TV in 2007 and got an upgrade to HD in 2010<sup><a
								href="#note-29">29</a></sup>
						Early on
						their artists have joined YouTube and Spotify. Additionally, their Planeta Derby concerts are some of the
						most visited public venues in the country. In general, Planeta Payner has long overshadowed Ara or any
						other production house, so much to be called a ‘mastodon’ by the singer Milko Kalayzhiev.</p>
					<p> Retrospective collections are compiled since 2004, preserving the ‘top hits of the industry’. Typically
						these have come to be known as ‘retro chalga’. What defines a song as ‘retro’ is unclear? But it
						is
						essential to understand that generally these songs are widely accepted and have acquired a much more
						nostalgic status. One comment under the video <span class='link'><a

					<p class="quote">When we get drunk all Bulgarians love retro chalga, regardless of being metalheads,
						rappers, Eurodance fans or whatever other music!</p>
					<p> There are countless comments like this. And it happens outside of the internet as well. My
						brother-in-law is a metalhead can start his casual evening with Two minutes to
						Midnight by Iron Maiden and
						switch around 2 o’clock in the morning to Седем бели коня (Seven White
						Horses) by Orkestar Oasis (Fig.13 & 14). When I
						asked my cousin to talk about chalga she humorously said ‘I don’t listen to the new stuff, only retro
						chalga’. I wondered what makes the ‘new chalga’ so embarrassing to listen to? When I asked Milko
						Kalayzhiev, one of the most influential artists in the genre, he revealed how the Estrada performers were
						deliberately trying to publicly shame chalga. Estrada is a pop genre created during Socialist times as a
						substitute to Western pop. It projected a vision of love, elegance and chivalry, in accordance to certain
						Socialist ideals. By contrast chalga radiated eroticism, hedonism and opulence. The bitter truth,
						according to Milko, however, is that when Estrada fell out of favour, the performers lost their work. It
						was old, sluggish music that exemplified a long-past age.</p>

					<p> The concert Milko refers to is the annual concert of Planeta Payner where thousands of people show up
						because it is contemporary, affordable and spectacular. There will be more experienced and newly-emerged
						performers. For 30 years of history, the genre has changed. Now the songs sound more ‘pop’ (that
						is
						Western pop) and include hip-hop and trap elements. However, the occasional clarinet or trumpet solo
						reminds us it is still Bulgarian music. The artists adapt and their representation goes along. If in 2004
						Azis caused a scandal<sup><a id="fnote-31" href="#note-31">31</a></sup> with a billboard (Fig.15) that
						stated ‘Азис Как
						боли’ (Azis How it
						hurts) showing
						his nude ass, now the standards have changed. Some artists go much further with how they present
						themselves like Suzanita, daughter of the chalga artist Orhan Murad, who also caused a
						scandal<sup><a id="fnote-32" href="#note-32">32</a></sup> because
						she dressed so ‘indecently’ despite being only 14 (Fig.16). These ‘scandals’ remind us
						that this is a
						show-business like any other and attracting attention is just a means to an end.</p>

					</figure>
					<p> Nowadays, the general appearance of the chalga artists, after the era of fake boobs and lips, is
						relatively toned down. Looking at a typical billboard with the faces of the evening’s performers, it does
						not diverge from Western pop, Estrada or even rock and metal band aesthetics. Many of the chalga artists
						simply do not need any more scandalous behaviour to be famous due to their reputation or because Planeta
						Payner uses its massive media network to easily promote them.</p>

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a id="chapter6">Enter the Chalga-verse</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p> In chalga, aesthetics follow content. It is hardly surprising that artists and their videos are opulent,
						light-hearted and sexual. Looking into overarching themes of wealth and money, enjoyment and peace of
						mind, love and eroticism and sometimes acute politics, one can start to understand where it all comes from
						and what chalga represents.</p>
					<h4 class="subtitle chapter-subtitle">Wealth</h4>
					<p> Mafia-baroque or Mutro-baroque<sup><a id="fnote-33" href="#note-33">33</a></sup> is a particular
						aesthetics that the
						Bulgarian mafia (Fig.17) has
						acquired in
						the 90s. Many Bulgarians often considered chalga the music of the new economic elite—the nouveaux
						riches<sup><a id="fnote-34" href="#note-34">34</a></sup> in the 90s and it is not much different nowadays
						(Fig.18). I have
						heard
						people talk about money
						for as
						long as I can remember. Bulgarian society is entranced by the idea of being rich, influenced by the
						rose-tinted vision of the Western life and technically free to achieve anything with no political

						Мъни,
						мъни (Money, money) where the singer sheds light (Fig.19) on the secret of life: money. </p>
					<p class="quote"> That’s what

						Liya we witness all the trouble (Fig.20) she
						has to go through in order to smuggle her cargo. She is stopped at the border, so the guards can check
						thoroughly the car. Liya hopes she can easily go through, calls her mother for support and begs the
						guards.
						The voice of reason joins her mental process to suggest giving the guards 200 marks. At the end 'they are
						also people/ they need some for cigarettes and some to build a house'.</p>

					<p> Nowadays there are fewer songs specifically about money, but it has stayed a leitmotif nevertheless. In
						2013 song<span class="link"><a
								href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoyU93LfNPI&list=PLZQ61YpXrZVbPIAUD1gbw1vbf1IVa9Q62&index=9'> За
								Пари (About money)</a></span> by Galena no currency is
						mentioned
						because it makes no difference. The
						protagonist is singing about the power and allure of money. She is talking to a beautiful strong man whom
						she advises that talking ‘about money’ is all he needs. Simply ‘For money, for money, you speak/ this word
						women love even more than sex’. More subtly, some videos abundantly show wealth to the audience. Prominent
						in the clothes of the singers and actors, their cars, yachts or planes and the locations the events
						unravel. A good example is Не Ме Оставяй (Don’t Leave Me) by Fiki and
						Tsvetelina Yaneva. The video (Fig.21)
						radiates wealth and money to a microscopic level. We witness a long, pan view of the mansion the video is
						shot, the elaborate architecture and exotic furniture, all the adorned objects inside ending with a
						fabulous appearance of the slow-motion gait of Fiki and the flowing silky dress of Tsvetelina.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle chapter-subtitle">Enjoyment</h4>
					<p> To acquire wealth is a goal of many, but sometimes it is more important just to enjoy life. Music on the
						Balkans has a great tradition of joyful tavern performance at least since the inter-war
						period,<sup><a id="fnote-35" href="#note-35">35</a></sup> where
						people eat, drink and sing along. Valdes’s Рибна Фиеста (Fish Fiesta) besides being vulgar and
						provocative, it shows the performer entertaining his guests and friends at a table, where they drink,
						laugh and enjoy the music. Another classic track is <span
							class='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNMAk8vK7RM&list=PLZQ61YpXrZVZt13ySxbAg36wjjwz06XkG&index=18'>Шопската
							Салата (The Shopska
							Salad)</span> by Rado
						Shisharkata which is simply dedicated to the Shopska Salad, summer salad from tomatoes, cucumbers, spring
						onion and cheese. It commemorates the little joys in the singer’s life like the salad, the alcohol
						mastika, blonde girls and his desire to spend all his heaps of money at the seaside, where he can lie on
						the beach with his loved one under the stars. Additional aspect of this hedonism is excitement which can
						be more clearly heard in the Нещо Нетипично (Something Untypical) by
						Ivana. There the singer is done with
						all the cliches of modern life (Fig.22) and yearns an exciting, wild night out. The very first verse is an
						imperative ‘Why don’t we get drunk/ let’s break all the foolish cliches/ let’s get wild tonight’. Her
						appeal for more excitement, an escape from the boring daily life resonates greatly with many people who
						miss something besides money in their lives.</p>

					<figcaption>Fig.22 Нещо Нетипично (Something Untypical) by Ivana</figcaption>
					<h4 class="subtitle chapter-subtitle">Eroticism and Love</h4>
					<p> The most characteristic quality of chalga is its eroticism and love problematics. As we have already
						established, Romani culture has a tremendous effect on the chalga music and aesthetics. The belly-dance in
						particular is an erotic element that has transformed and it relies more on the scantily-clad female sex
						symbols.<sup><a id="fnote-36" href="#note-36">36</a></sup> Historically, Bulgaria never had belly-dancing as
						it was
						popular in Arabia usually
						performed
						by minority groups like the Romani people.<sup><a id="fnote-37" href="#note-37">37</a></sup> This eroticism,
						however, has
						proven to be a fantastic
						marketing
						tool that they have nothing to do with. In the 90s, dancers shook their bodies alongside singers on
						the
						stage but with the advance of cable TV this kind of imagery has totally exploded. To a western person,
						this may seem as too much provocation from a music video full of dancing male and female bodies.</p>
					<p> Most music videos in the beginning included lots of Arabic themes where the proverbial belly dancer is
						capturing our eye. She moves with the rhythm and we gape at her, mentally caressing her flexible body.
						Appropriating the dance, she has mainly an erotic purpose, usually leading to a very tragic performance.
						On many occаsions, for example in Milko Kalayzdhiev turbo classic song Къде си, батко? (Where are you, big
						brother?), the idea for harem, where a man is surrounded (Fig.23) by beautiful playful women, is
						very prominent.
						And besides, the themes of the videos, the average look of the female singers is absolutely stunning as
						they have the most fabulous hairstyles, make-up and body figures. In 1996 Mitko Dimitrov the owner of
						Payner explained that ‘good look’ is essential for success and if a singer is not so good-looking they use
						pin-up girls for the cassette covers.<sup><a id="fnote-38" href="#note-38">38</a></sup> Nowadays, eroticism
						holds the
						same importance, the only
						difference being more contemporary in fashion.</p>
					<figure class="videoWrapper">

					</figure>
					<figcaption>Fig.23 Къде си,
						батко? (Where are you, big
						brother?) by Milko Kalaydzhiev</figcaption>

					<p> As most pop songs, however, chalga revolves around love and all its subsidiery themes: heartbreak,
						infidelity, sex. And this is the big power of chalga: its lyrics. Accused to be ‘laid-back and
						shallow’
						these songs are meant to be summer hits and nothing more. People compare those with folk songs like <span
							class='link'> <a
								href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBxCf4udigU&list=PLZQ61YpXrZVaYo-BNuAIV5NenQctQhsld&index=5">
								Земи
								огин, запали ме (Take this fire, burn me)</a></span>, which are supposedly much more
						meaningful.
						A
						song about a man
						who cannot live his life anymore chasing his beloved, so she better set him on fire and end his misery.
						Loads of folk ballads celebrate the love between people. Other comparisons are made with the passionate
						tracks by Lili Ivanova or Emil Dimitrov, some of the Estrada singers from Socialist times. And even with
						Stari gradski pesni (Old-city songs) that became popular in the inter-war period.</p>
					<p> Despite the difficult times after 1989, chalga also holds a few very intimate songs, which can hardly be
						accused of profanity. <span class='link'><a
								href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrZ88gOIq6I&list=PLZQ61YpXrZVZt13ySxbAg36wjjwz06XkG&index=47">Богиньо
								моя (My
								goddess)</a></span> by Maksim is a deeply
						sentimental ballad telling the story
						of someone who sings only about his ‘goddess’ and will do anything to win her heart. Or the
						female
						perspective in Погледни ме в очите (Look me in the eyes) by Aneliya
						where love is portrayed as something
						ultimate (Fig.24) where no lies, no pain or anger will change it. So overall, it is not so hard to find
						meaningful
						songs in a sea of light-hearted and humorous tracks.</p>

					<figcaption>Fig.24 Погледни ме в очите (Look me in the eyes) by Aneliya</figcaption>
					<h4 class="subtitle chapter-subtitle">Politics</h4>
					<p> Finally, a side of chalga that is somehow obscured is its political power. In the 90s Valdes and Slavi
						Trifonov said what they wanted with their music as already mentioned: Рибна фиеста (Fish fiesta) and
						Тайсън Кючек (Tajsun Kyuchek) respectively. At that time the Bulgarian punk movement also developed
						strongly, other rock and metal bands stood for their beliefs. In general, the last decade of the 20th
						century had a lot to unpack.<sup><a id="fnote-39" href="#note-39">39</a></sup> With the turn of the century,
						there were
						other players in the
						game. The
						Hip-Hop collectives like Ъпсурт (Upsurt) and Спенс (Spens) were very political. However, in the 21st
						century chalga music and producers became more and more intertwined with secular authority. Before every
						election there are public concerts paid by political parties and as the politicians need to reach the most
						people, chalga is the logical choice. Of course this does not mean that chalga singers are associated
						directly with the commissioners' political orientation. Mafia members from the 90s are still in the
						political circles. And as some chalga singers glorified the mafia then, now they cannot criticise and
						ridicule the government filled with their old acquaintances.</p>
					<h4 class="subtitle chapter-subtitle">Visual language as a device for marketing</h4>
					<p> The aesthetics of chalga videos are anything but boring. Since their genesis they have followed the
						Western process of production. In the 90s, the typical formula was the MTV video. There were 3 types of
						clips—documentation of concerts or performances, narrative videos and music-based videos.<sup><a
								href="#note-40">40</a></sup>
						Documentation were and still are very common amongst more traditional folklore videos of the singer,
						usually accompanied by the orchestra, in a ‘traditional setting’ full of rugs, pottery in a generic 19th
						century house. Older performances of Tony Dacheva’s Сладка работа (Sweet
						job) or Kondyo’s Доко Доко (Doko
						Doko) give perfectly accurate impression (Fig.25 & 26), as well as any video on <span class='link'><a
								href="http://www.seirsanduk.us/planeta-folk-online">Planeta Folk
								TV</a></span>, Tyankov
						TV or Rodina TV
						which position their singers in backyards, taverns and rocks on a river bank.</p>

					<figcaption>Fig.26 Доко Доко (Doko
						Doko) by Kondyo</figcaption>
					<p> Narrative videos have linear plots, without much depth, depicting a simple story line based on the
						lyrics, which the viewer can follow. In the video of Rumyana <span class='link'><a
								href="https://www.youtube.com/MEv1NKbTssk">Ало, такси (‘Allo,
								taxi)</a></span> we observe the
						singer who wants to reach the seaside hitchhiking. She gets into a taxi, Mercedes, almost ends up in an
						old Trabant, and finally she rides in a Golf. The last one she sings about is a BMW, but we see a
						Volkswagen. Unfortunately, we’ll never know what happened production-wise there. The narrative simply
						reflects the lyrics, showing a young woman using her charm to get to the beach. Through the years, the
						production quality of the clips have drastically improved, but the depth of the story not much. A video
						(Fig.27)
						like Нула време (Zero time) by Milko Kalaydzhiev is full of expensive
						cars and airplanes, shot with high
						quality cameras and drones but it doesn’t add too much to the song. Milko wants forgiveness from his lover

					<p> Sometimes videos break totally free from the lyrics of the singer and build their own world. The
						aforementioned Левовете в марки (Levs in marks) by Sashka Vaseva is exemplary of absolute visual freedom.
						Sashka is singing about drinking and money exchange but the video is exploring its own universe. The
						techno rhythms combined with MIDI violins provide an excellent playground for all kinds of dancing
						silhouettes, double exposures with fire and erotic close-ups of female and male bodies. Tsvetelina
						Yaneva’s 2019 song Ангелът (The Angel) is about a love drama that
						killed the angel in her… However, the
						clip (Fig.28) is not dramatising this instead it takes a marvellously colourful vaporwave, neo-cyberpunk
						that is
						abstract and open to interpretation.</p>

					<p> At the end, the visual language of chalga is more than the sum of its parts. In isolation, chalga is
						pop-music and the tropes it uses can be applied to Western, Latin American or East Asian music. But the
						mix of new technology, provocative performances, exuberant make-up and jewellery with traditional
						landscapes and taverns or expensive cars and hotels creates a unique phenomenon.</p>

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a id="chapter7">On Accepting Chalga</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p> The controversial status of chalga provides a multi-angle view by the audience. The artists were
						showering in fame and acknowledgement, the majority of Bulgarians enjoyed listening to the music. My
						parents’ generation let their children listen freely to the music and many aspired to become the next
						superstars.<sup><a id="fnote-41" href="#note-41">41</a></sup> Ex-Yugoslavian, Greek and Romanian music was
						intertwining
						with chalga and a
						peculiar
						Balkan musical exchange formed. The intellectuals were closely following its development and it even
						intrigued many American and Balkan researchers to deeply analyse the phenomenon. And to this day the
						discourse around chalga is layered and complicated because it concerns the ‘democratic period’ with all
						its turbulent political and cultural transitions. What is needed is calm appreciation and criticism of the
						music.</p>
					<p> Other Balkan people seemingly perceive this type of music differently. A Serbian art student from Niš
						made an iconic representation of Ceca (Fig.29), the Serbian pop queen, to capture the respect people have
						for her.
						She transcended being a mere mortal, she became a saint.<sup><a id="fnote-42" href="#note-42">42</a></sup>
						Her wedding
						in the 90s with the
						military
						leader Arkan was an extraordinary event<sup><a id="fnote-43" href="#note-43">43</a></sup> (Fig.30) and many
						of her songs
						are
						listened to even today.</p>

					</figure>
					<p> That is not to say that all Serbians are proud of turbo-folk and they share it with everybody but
						there
						is a discussion around it. In the 90s, some youngsters saw turbo-folk as the music of the
						peasants.<sup><a id="fnote-44" href="#note-44">44</a></sup>
						People with low culture, simple needs, financially deprived who moved to the city and brought the
						simplicity with them. The underground scene escaped this reality through hip-hop and techno. Nowadays,
						what used to be music reflecting the insecurity and injustice of the 90s, have transformed into a scar
						reminding people what they have heroically endured. Thus the charge of turbo-folk is completely relieved
						from this pain and people nostalgically celebrate their youth with the most memorable tracks.</p>
					<p> In Bulgaria thankfully, younger generations (<span class='link'><a
								href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlfVGKH4hjs&list=PLZQ61YpXrZVbPIAUD1gbw1vbf1IVa9Q62&index=2">Mila
								Robert</a></span> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mojogoro">Goro</a>)
						slowly begin to stray away from
						being
						ashamed and instead experiment and provoke by positioning it as classical tracks, making cover versions
						or
						injecting it in-between techno tracks. The Bulgarian intelligentsia, however, has retreated from the
						field. They have grown to discuss only very specific areas of society in the Socialist period. There
						wasn’t much alternative culture at the time anyways. When chalga was developing some of them showed
						interest and shared their opinions. Academics like Rosmary Statelova<sup><a id="fnote-45"
								href="#note-45">45</a></sup>,
						Kler Levi<sup><a id="fnote-46" href="#note-46">46</a></sup>,
						Ventsislav
						Dimov<sup><a id="fnote-47" href="#note-47">47</a></sup> have genuinely been interested in the topic and
						until this day
						they produce objective
						and
						accurate analyses. Kler Levi talks about the syndrome of the curled eyebrow which is an
						indicator of
						the
						contempt that some academics have against chalga. An article<sup><a id="fnote-48"
								href="#note-48">48</a></sup> of hers
						was seminal because it
						shifted
						the initial problematics of ‘For or against chalga’ to ‘What is chalga and what does it mean for the
						Bulgarian society?’. In the 2000s with the advance of online blogs and small publications many
						philosophers, journalist and parvenues have shared their disgust with chalga music and industry without
						contributing much to the discourse. In recent years there have been many negative news articles
						analysing
						chalga and few real in-depth overviews<sup><a id="fnote-49" href="#note-49">49</a></sup> I was not surprised
						when the
						journalist Martin
						Karbovsky, who
						has written about chalga, rejected my request to interview him. Humorously when asked ‘Would you share
						your reservations for discussing chalga?’ he answered laconically ‘No.’ Overall, chalga is unattractive
						for academics, at least in Bulgaria. Perhaps there is too much emotions floating around the topic that
						seemingly they ignore it awaiting its final hour. </p>

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a id="chapter8">Conclusion</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p> But chalga is not dying. It was naturally born from the frustration and celebration of the Balkan
						person, who desires to belong to a community. Whether this is a community of post-Soviet countries,
						post-Ottoman states or European nations, Bulgaria wanted to enter a new age. Chalga is not a symptom or a
						cause for the political, economic or cultural situation. Chalga is a consequence, it is a device to cope
						with struggle and identity formation. The music was born by centuries of culture-blending and social
						uproar. The Socialist faux identity of ‘the pure nation’ infected the Bulgarian society with shame for
						this inclusive history. This remorse always baffled me and I hoped I can partly heal it by delving into
						the essence of chalga. By defining where chalga comes from, what it reflects and why it is so widely
						criticised. Hopefully, we can come to terms with our past and understand our present without shame or
						guilt. Only then we can start changing our society according to our circumstances, abilities and needs.

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a id="chapter9">Afterword</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p> For many years, I didn’t understand chalga or the people who listened to it. But the controversy around
						it always intrigued me. I understood it is about aesthetics and morals, but did not connect politics or
						identity with it. The very first time I thought about any connection was when I listened to Valdes’ Рибна
						фиеста (Fish Fiesta). The moment when he sings about ‘fucking the law’ sparked a link. A link to the
						stereotypical Bulgarian macho who always knows how to trick the system. And I started listening to more
						and more songs and to find small bits of information that reflected a piece of history. Sharing this with
						friends and strangers I was always greeted with the same look— ‘the syndrome of the curled eyebrow’ —
						because they thought I was joking. Almost always, however, they agreed with me when I gave them a few
						examples. ‘But today it is only crap...’ they continued when we brought the discussion to current times. I
						found this so weird: to be so incredibly close-minded and deeply affected by one music genre.</p>
					<p> When I started writing, I still got curious looks and a lot of my friends disagreed with me. But most of
						them were also intrigued to read something on a topic they have always considered unworthy to explore. I
						did not know why I am writing about it, but during the research what kept me going was the constant
						paradoxes that emerged. A paradox that people fill the clubs, but the deny listening to it. A paradox that
						it is something so Bulgarian and yet many are ashamed of it. Recently, the new song of Zarko 52 ле'а
						разходи (Costs for 52 leva) was released. In essence his song is chalga but paradoxically
						people do not
						perceive it as such. They see it as a ridicule of chalga, they look into its meaning, comment on the video
						(Fig.31)
						and relate to it.<sup><a id="fnote-50" href="#note-50">50</a></sup> But in its purest form chalga is a
						ridicule of
						society. So how is chalga
						not worth
						discussing, but a joke about it is?</p>

					<p> Being a sensitive topic, I wanted to explore many points of view. And I got this wider angle by reading
						appropriate literature, interviewing many different people and rummaging through social media just so I
						can understand what comprises this phenomenon. I hope that this research provides a clear understanding of
						chalga and opens the gateway to new works. Whatever new musical trend comes, it will adapt and continue to
						entertain people. Discussions, whether chalga is good or not, are useless because it is here and it is not
						going anywhere.</p><br>
